        <p>Turning confusion into working code, one late night at a time.</p>
        <p>
          I spend most of my days coding, debugging, learning, and repeating the
          cycle until things finally make sense. I like understanding how things
          work, not just making them work.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am someone who spends most of my time writing code, breaking it,
          fixing it, and trying to understand why it behaved the way it did. I
          don’t claim to know everything, but I care deeply about learning
          things properly and not just making them work by accident.
        </p>

        <p>
          My days usually revolve around experimenting with ideas, building
          small projects, and improving my understanding of how software systems
          work under the hood. I enjoy the process of learning through trial,
          error, and persistence.
        </p>

        <p>
          What keeps me interested in programming is the problem-solving. There
          is something satisfying about taking a confusing problem, breaking it
          into smaller pieces, and slowly turning it into something clear and
          functional.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe progress comes from consistency. Coding every day, even in
          small amounts, adds up over time. Mistakes are part of the process,
          and each bug is an opportunity to understand something a little better
          than before.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website exists as a simple record of my journey — the things I
          have built, the ideas I am exploring, and the skills I am developing.
          It is not a finished product, just like me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am focused on improving my fundamentals, writing clearer code, and
          building projects that reflect real understanding rather than surface-
          level knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are interested in what I am building or want to connect, feel
          free to explore the rest of the site.
